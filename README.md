# SF-Test-Project
Test project of the SF Data Analyst / Data Scientist course.

Goal: To create a machine learning model which predicts, how long will the cab spend in traffic based on daytime, location, etc.

Data: 15000+ taxi rides from Ecuador - Quito. Each ride has 10 features like pickup_datetime, pickup/dropoff latitude/longitude, taxi company, distance etc.

What did I do?

exploratory data analysis
data cleaning
feature engineering
feature selection
I trained few machine learning models and measured their performance.
I created a complete pipeline and summarized whole process into a single function, which can be used on the "aim" data, for which the prediction should be carried out.
